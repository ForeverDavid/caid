Overview
========

**CAID** is built around the workgroup concept. Each workgroup contains an inspector and a viewer. In the future, it will also contain solvers as well as diagnotics modules.
Inspector

This is where you can navigate/manipulate all geometries objects. Each geometry object contains a list of patchs and some additional informations, like the *connectivity*, *internal/external faces*. A *geometry* is simply the **cad_geometry** object that you can get from the igakit package.
